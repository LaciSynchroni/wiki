# 3 - Installing Laci
:::info Work-In-Progress

At the moment, only the compile-from-source setup with Cloudflare Tunnel is available. Cloudflare Tunnel is free for non-commercial use,
and it **compiles by starting a script**. You don't have to bring any C#/.net knowledge!

So, while this setup is a smidge more involved, it's perfectly serviceable and actually recommended to use if you want to be always up-to-date
or do tiny customizations yourself.

:::

Right now, the only available setup is through our GH repo. You will have to have Docker and Git installed on your server.

Please follow the steps outlined in [this readme here](https://github.com/LaciSynchroni/server/blob/main/Docker/Readme.md)
